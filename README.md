👋 Hi, I'm Alberto Lara,

I drive business performance and operational strategy through data-driven decision making.
My role sits at the intersection of analytics, pricing, operations and executive enablement, turning complex data into clear actions with measurable impact. 

Over the last years, I’ve led initiatives that: 
 
- Increased gross profit across multiple countries (with high six-figure impact). 
- Automated financial and operational processes, reducing manual workload and improving accuracy across teams. 
- Standardised pricing strategies for international FX and ATM operations. 
- Provided C-level stakeholders with dashboards and insights used in daily decision making. 
 
I manage a skilled technical team, translate business needs into executable plans, and ensure that analytics, product and operations work in the same direction. 
My focus is always on business value, not on tools. 
 
What I’m good at: 
 
- Operational management and business performance leadership. 
- Turning data problems into business recommendations. 
- Pricing / margins strategy and performance optimisation. 
- Leading cross-functional projects across countries and departments. 
- Building reporting systems adopted by large non-technical audiences. 
 
Let’s connect:
